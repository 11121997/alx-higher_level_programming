Everything is object project
============================
1- All data in python is represented by objects and every object has (id, type ,name)
2- classes are the blue print -> object is an actual thing that is built based on the blue print -> instance is a virtual copy of an object but "not a real copy"
3- mutable objects are those that can be changed after they are created like "lists , dictionaries"
	but immutable objects can't be changed like "strings, integers , tuples"
4- the reference is the name that refers to the specific location in the memory of a value(object)
5- assinment: this type of statement lets you creat, initialize and update the variables throughout your code
6- Alias: the second name of the piece of data is known as alias
7- using "==" to test if two variables are equal
8- keyword "is" used to test if two variables refer to the same object
9- id() function used to find memory address refrenced by a variable
10- built-in mutable types "list, sets, dictionary"
11- built-in immutable types "Numbers(integer, rational, float, decimal, complex, booleans), Strings, Tubles"
12- Use syntax function_name(value1, value2) to pass values to function_name
